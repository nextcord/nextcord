# Your bot token should not be made public with your code. Otherwise, anyone can sign in as your bot and mess with its servers.
# You should load the token as an environment variable, then access it like this:

import os

# There are other ways to load environment variables but this is one
from dotenv import load_dotenv  # https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/

from nextcord.ext import commands

# load_dotenv reads from a file called .env in the same directory as the python files which should roughly look like BOT_TOKEN="1234567890"
load_dotenv()

bot = commands.Bot()

# run the bot using the token in .env
bot.run(os.environ["BOT_TOKEN"])
