Migrating to nextcord
======================

Due to the `original discord.py repository <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`_ going to read only we decided
that it would be necessary to fork it and keep on developing further. We also wanted to change the name and voted on
nextcord, in order of properly registering at pypi.
